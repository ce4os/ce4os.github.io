<p>Hi, I'm Zephyros. I'm a curious person who enjoys learning new things, whether it's languages, new tools to use or new people. The world is so vast and the journy so short. About two years ago, I got into Linux and programming, and I found it truly fascinating. Using the terminal and writing my own code has been a source of wonder for me. That's why I've decided to pursue professional programming, starting with Python Backend. My goal is to continue exploring and expanding my skills in the world of technology.</p>

<p>Currently I am working on developing the fundamental skills needed to pursue a career in tech</p>
